# Prompt-Guided Augmentation and Multi-modal Fusion for Argumentative Fallacy Classification

This repository accompanies our paper:

**"Prompt-Guided Augmentation and Multi-modal Fusion for Argumentative Fallacy Classification in Political Debates"**

We provide:

- Notebooks for data preprocessing, augmentation, and model evaluation
- Augmented dataset (CSV) for reproducibility
- README with instructions to explore the data and reproduce key insights

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Abdullahtahirrr/prompt-guided-augmentation-fallacy-classifier.git
   cd prompt-guided-augmentation-fallacy-classifier
   ```

2. Install dependencies:  
   The notebooks use standard Python data science libraries. You can install them with:

   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Reproducing Results

- Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore:
  - Data preprocessing and augmentation
  - Model training and evaluation workflows
- The augmented dataset is provided as a CSV in `data/` for direct use in your own experiments.
